  improve kernel_to_matrix, basically everything else also
  
* checks
test zeros in AD
  
** JIT
+ make overlap, kinetic, nuclear, interaction more transparent
+ overlap, kinetic : only supply l_max => derive t_arr; convenience wrapper to automate determination of l_max?

** AD
seems to mostly work, but zeros out for diagonals in S, T and orbitals on same nucleus for V, U might be fine, what is going on?
   
* Performance
+ Incorporate symmetries
