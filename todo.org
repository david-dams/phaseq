* Test
+ scf
+ AD: compare to pyqint
    
* FIX
+ AD: identical positions give wrong results

* Hygiene
+ improve scf efficiency
+ doc strings for all functions  
+ make overlap, kinetic, nuclear, interaction more transparent
+ improve general readability
+ deriv: cleanup, add limits

* maybe
+ <f|x**n|f'>, localization for n=1, need to fix vanishing gradient on diagonal for this
+ some nice post-HF like MP, CI
+ clever screening / use symmetries
