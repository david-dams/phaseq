test interaction contracted

test overlap diagonal derivative, make comparison to FD
test kinetic diagonal derivative, make comparison to FD
test interaction derivative

test overlap contracted derivative
test kinetic contracted derivative
test nuclear contracted derivative
test interaction contracted derivative    

** JIT
+ make overlap, kinetic, nuclear, interaction more transparent
+ overlap, kinetic : only supply l_max => derive t_arr; convenience wrapper to automate determination of l_max?

** AD
check diag for all
overlap, kinetic goes kaputt for diagonal elements   

* Performance
+ Incorporate symmetries
