test interaction contracted

test overlap diagonal derivative
test kinetic diagonal derivative
test nuclear derivative
test interaction derivative

test overlap contracted derivative
test kinetic contracted derivative
test nuclear contracted derivative
test interaction contracted derivative    

** JIT
+ make overlap, kinetic, nuclear, interaction more transparent

** AD
overlap, kinetic goes kaputt for diagonal elements   

* Performance
+ Incorporate symmetries
