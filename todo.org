* checks
+ test zeros in AD
+ test on GPU
  
** AD
+ seems to mostly work, but zeros out for diagonals (i.e. identical positions) in S, T and orbitals on same nucleus for V, U might be fine, what is going on?

* SCF
+ implement simple HF
+ implement symmetry-based SCF / screening

* Hygiene
+ doc strings for all functions  
+ make overlap, kinetic, nuclear, interaction more transparent
+ convenience wrapper to automate determination of l_max?

* maybe
+ <f|x**n|f'>, localization for n=1, need to fix vanishing gradient on diagonal for this
+ some nice post-HF like MP, CI
