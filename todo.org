* Test
+ scf
    
* FIX
+ identical positions give wrong results

* Hygiene
+ doc strings for all functions  
+ make overlap, kinetic, nuclear, interaction more transparent
+ improve general readability

* maybe
+ <f|x**n|f'>, localization for n=1, need to fix vanishing gradient on diagonal for this
+ some nice post-HF like MP, CI
+ clever screening / use symmetries
