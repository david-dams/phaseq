# PhaseQ 

Differentiable Electron matrix elements.

# What is this?

This project implements Gaussian electron matrix elements in JAX. It is based on the non-recursive expressions derived by [Takaeta et al.](https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~pbarfuss/jpsj.21.2313.pdf). To make JAX like these expressions, they are recast into an array-oriented form, as detailed in deriv.org.
